## Description

<hr/>

### ‘brio’

bri·o /ˈbrēō/
_noun_
vigor or vivacity of style or performance

An anti-doldrum motivator - a mobile app that will intake new users and suggest actionable goals and remove roadblocks that can get in the way of ever starting good habits and desirable wellness.

## The Problem

<hr />
So many people in this moment are feeling unmotivated, disconnected, and generally down. They are plagued by an unprecedented amount of free time, but no way to get started on the goals and activities they’ve always wanted to accomplish. Further more, with less daily structure it’s often hard to maintain routines which garner real results.

This presents an ironic problem. How does one get started? And how does one stay with it once they do?
and remove roadblocks that can get in the way of ever starting good habits and desirable wellness.

<hr />

## The Solution

‘Brio’ quickly represents an amorphous entity or cute helper creature personified. It’s relatable and helpful entity, encouraging a relationship with the application. The name can also take advantage of the ‘IO’ in the word while boosting the innate concept of the application which is an energy and warmth through participation. ‘Input’ begets ‘Output’ in perpetuity: the fundamental notion of good habits.
